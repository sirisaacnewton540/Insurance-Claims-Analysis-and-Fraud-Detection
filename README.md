## Introduction
Insurance fraud is a significant issue that impacts insurance companies and policyholders alike. By analyzing insurance claims data, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. This analysis helps in improving claims processing efficiency and detecting fraud early.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a hypothetical insurance claims dataset. It includes information on policy details, insured individuals, incident details, claim amounts, and whether the claim was reported as fraudulent.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Notebook Overview
The notebook is divided into several steps:

1. **Load the Dataset:** Load the insurance claims dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

2. **Clean and Preprocess the Dataset:** Handle missing values and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze trends in claim types and amounts, and visualize the distributions.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Detect anomalies in the total claim amounts and other features using box plots and scatter plots.

5. **Analyze Claims Processing Times:** (If available) Analyze and visualize claims processing times to identify workflow bottlenecks.

6. **Analysis of Fraudulent Claims:** Identify common factors in fraudulent claims using correlation analysis and feature importance from a Random Forest classifier.

7. **Visualization of Key Factors:** Visualize the most important features that predict fraud and their distributions for fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.

## Results

### Step 1: Load the Dataset
The dataset is loaded successfully, and the first few rows are displayed.

### Step 2: Clean and Preprocess the Dataset
Missing values are handled, and the dataset is preprocessed for analysis.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1. Distribution of Total Claim Amounts
![1](https://github.com/shagoftakhan1605/Insurance_Claim/assets/173546811/f413f61b-fa83-4736-bbce-6d980c5f0cfd)
- This histogram shows the distribution of total claim amounts. The KDE plot indicates that there is a significant number of low-value claims and a few high-value claims.

#### 2. Count of Different Incident Types
![2](https://github.com/shagoftakhan1605/Insurance_Claim/assets/173546811/612e49d2-000c-4d55-b98c-8331db3c510c)
- This bar chart shows the frequency of different types of incidents. Multi-vehicle collisions and single-vehicle collisions are the most common types of incidents reported.

### Step 4: Anomaly Detection

#### 3. Box Plot of Total Claim Amounts
![3](https://github.com/shagoftakhan1605/Insurance_Claim/assets/173546811/12e5c9eb-870a-45d3-9a48-240688a9c0dc)
- The box plot visualizes the spread of total claim amounts and highlights any outliers. Most claims fall within a certain range, but there are some high-value outliers.

#### 4. Scatter Plot of Age vs. Total Claim Amount
![4](https://github.com/shagoftakhan1605/Insurance_Claim/assets/173546811/6ff26668-e5d2-49f9-8a6a-35fff3ee7026)
- This scatter plot shows the relationship between the age of the insured and the total claim amount. There is no clear trend, but some high-value claims are scattered across different ages.

### Step 5: Analyze Claims Processing Times
- The dataset does not contain a `claims_processing_time` column.

### Step 6: Analysis of Fraudulent Claims

#### Comparison of Fraudulent and Non-Fraudulent Claims
- This table shows the average values of various features for fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims. Fraudulent claims tend to have higher policy deductibles, umbrella limits, total claim amounts, injury claims, property claims, and vehicle claims.
